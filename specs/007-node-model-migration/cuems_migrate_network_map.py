"""Convert a deployed node's ``network_map.xml`` from ``node_type`` to ``node_role``.

**Reference implementation, not yet the shipped artifact.** Feature 007's `cuems-common`
work (US3, T013 in `tasks.md`) is out of scope for this pass — see
`migration-guide.md` — but T015 (converting `cuems-utils`'s own corpus) and the
schema/model work both depend on a script whose correctness is established
independently of the corpus it converts (plan.md's phasing note: goldens are
never regenerated to make a test pass; the *script* does the converting, and
the script has its own tests). This file is that script, developed here so it
is testable now. When the `cuems-common` phase is picked up, this module's
``convert`` function is relocated **verbatim** to
``../cuems-common/usr/bin/cuems-migrate-network-map`` (stdlib only — no
``cuemsutils`` import, per the shared-venv rule in `CLAUDE.md`: `/usr/bin`
entry points cannot import the package the venv shadows).

Deliberately **stdlib-only** even here, to keep that relocation a file move
rather than a rewrite.

**Textual, line-oriented rewrite — not an ElementTree round trip** (research
R8). An ElementTree round trip would reformat the whole document
(indentation, attribute order, namespace prefix rendering), so it could not
honour "every other byte unchanged" and would not be idempotent in the byte
sense. A targeted regex rewrite touches only the matched elements.

**Value mapping**, accepting both legacy spellings because both exist in the
wild:

======================  ===============
found                   written
======================  ===============
``NodeType.master``     ``controller``
``master``              ``controller``
``NodeType.slave``      ``node``
``slave``               ``node``
``NodeType.firstrun``   ``firstrun``
``firstrun``            ``firstrun``
*anything else*         **the whole file is refused**
======================  ===============

A map mixing a recognised and an unrecognised value is refused whole — never
half-converted, since a document carrying both vocabularies is something no
requirement describes and no test can pin (M3).

# MANDATORY DIRECTIVE: Test Validity & Scope

## CORE PRINCIPLE: Meaningful and Actionable Tests

Ensure tests are meaningful, valid, and correctly scoped. Tests must strictly validate the real behavior of the code under test, avoiding irrelevant or misleading checks.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES OF TESTING

### 1. **General Principles**

- **Reflect Actual Logic:** Tests must reflect actual business and functional logic. Do not test implementation details irrelevant to the intended behavior.
- **Assert Real Behavior:** Assertions must target real outputs, side effects, or state changes, not mock setups or artificial constructs.
- **Avoid Redundancy:** Avoid redundant tests that re-validate what has already been fully tested elsewhere.
- **Clarity & Confidence:** Tests should be clear, self-contained, and provide confidence in code correctness.

### 2. **Unit Tests**

- **Isolation:** Focus on isolated components/functions.
- **Critical Branches:** Validate **all critical branches** of the logic, but avoid over-testing trivial or obvious framework-level behavior.
- **Coverage:** Ensure input/output correctness and error handling are properly covered.
- **Mock Usage:** Mocks/stubs are allowed to isolate dependencies, but **never assert on mocked behavior itself**.
- **Characteristics:** Unit tests must be **precise, atomic, deterministic, and fast**.

### 3. **Integration Tests**

- **Interaction Validation:** Validate the interaction between multiple real components, ensuring that contracts, data flows, and side effects behave as intended.
- **No Internal Mocking:** Do not mock internal components that are part of the integration under test.
- **End-to-End Focus:** Focus on **end-to-end behavior of combined units**, but still within controlled, testable boundaries (not full E2E).
- **Characteristics:** Integration tests must be **realistic, comprehensive, reliable, and maintainable**.

### 4. **Test Quality Enforcement**

- **Good Tests:** Good tests are **relevant, rigorous, maintainable, meaningful, and trustworthy**.
- **Avoid Bad Tests:** Bad tests (flaky, superficial, redundant, misleading) must be avoided.
- **Safety Net:** The overall test suite should act as a safety net, not a burden: it must inspire confidence, not false security.

## ENFORCEMENT

Ensure that new or modified tests follow these principles. Flag:

- Tests asserting on mocked calls or behavior.
- Tests duplicating coverage already provided elsewhere.
- Tests failing to validate real logic or missing critical scenarios.
- Unit or integration tests that are incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading.

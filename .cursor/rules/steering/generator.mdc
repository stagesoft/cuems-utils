# AI Document Generation Framework

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes a systematic approach for generating high-quality steering documents that facilitate decision-making and stakeholder alignment. The framework ensures consistent structure, evidence-based recommendations, and actionable outcomes across all document types.

## Document Generation Methodology

**Core Process:**

- **Context Analysis**: Comprehensive project file scanning and requirement extraction
- **Evidence Compilation**: Systematic gathering of supporting data from project sources
- **Template Application**: Structured formatting based on document type and scope
- **Quality Validation**: Verification of recommendations and action items
- **Output Generation**: Professional, actionable steering document delivery

**Key Principles:**

- Evidence-based decision making from actual project context
- Clear accountability with specific ownership assignments
- Consistent structure across all document types
- Maximum 2-page format for optimal readability

## Framework Requirements

**Essential Capabilities:**

1. **Adaptive Structure**: Dynamic document formatting based on request type and complexity
2. **Evidence Integration**: All recommendations grounded in actual project files and code analysis
3. **Decision Tracking**: Clear accountability with specific ownership and timelines
4. **Scope Management**: Appropriate boundaries between product, technical, and organizational documents
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation for completeness and actionability
